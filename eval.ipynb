Despite their small size in planetary sense, large asteroids can measure 530 kilometres in diameter. These are sometimes called minor planets. Occasionally, asteroids smash into each other, knocking off smaller pieces of rock that are called meteoroids. Their size can range from no bigger than a few molecules to 100 meters in diameter.\",\n",
    "  \"When meteoroids come close enough to be attracted by the Earth, they fall into our atmosphere and become a burning rock due to the friction between the falling objects and air molecules.

The nucleus of the egg is located inside the blastodisc.

Little do people know, all egg yolks actually contain tiny blood vessels that would deliver nutrients to the chick embryo if the egg is fertilised. If the blood vessels are broken during the laying process (usually occur when the hen is being startled), there will be blood spots on the egg yolk. That being said, even if you find blood spot on the egg yolk, the egg is still safe for consumption.
